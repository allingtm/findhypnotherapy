# Hypnotherapist Directory

## Project Summary

**Solve with Software Ltd | January 2026**

---

## Elevator Pitch

### The Problem

There are thousands of qualified hypnotherapists across the UK, but most struggle to find clients. They're competing against flashy wellness brands, battling Google's algorithms, and spending hours on marketing instead of helping people.

### The Solution

A dedicated directory platform that does one thing brilliantly: **help hypnotherapists get found by people who need them**.

Members get a professional profile that ranks for local searches, a platform to publish expert content that builds their authority, and tracked enquiries so they know exactly where their clients are coming from. We handle the SEO, the social media promotion, and the credibility—they focus on what they do best.

### Why It Works

Every feature is built around one goal: generating client enquiries. We vet members to ensure quality, moderate content to maintain standards, and actively promote practitioners through our channels. It's not just a listing—it's a client acquisition engine.

### The Business

£30/month (£10 for founding members). With an estimated 6,000–10,000 hypnotherapists in the UK, even modest penetration creates a sustainable, scalable business. Target: 200 members in year one, growing to 500 by year two.

### In One Sentence

**We help hypnotherapists stop worrying about marketing and start seeing more clients.**
